# LandSlideHySEA


## Introduction


HySEA (Hyperbolic Systems and Efficient Algorithms) is a high-performance package developed by the EDANYA group at the University of Málaga, Spain, for the simulation of geophysical flows.

LandSlide-HySEA is a module of HySEA to simulate tsunamis generated by landslides where the water layer is modelled using the SW equations and the sediment layer is modelled using the Savage-Hutter model.


## Requirements

A CUDA-capable GPU

CUDA >= 8.0

NetCDF

Parallel NetCDF

OpenMPI >= 2.1.2


## Compilation

1) Copy the file src/FindNetCDF.cmake into the CMake's shared modules directory.

2) make (L-HySEA.exe should be created).


## Execution

L-HySEA.exe <path to PValdez/data.dat>

The NetCDF file PValdez.nc is generated.


## File formats

The bathymetry file (.bat) is a binary file with double precision numerical values. For each volume, <longitude latitude bathymetry> are stored, ordered by rows and starting from the upper left corner.

The initial state file (.ini) is a binary file with double precision numerical values. For each volume, <eta qx qy> are stored, ordered by rows and starting from the upper left corner.
